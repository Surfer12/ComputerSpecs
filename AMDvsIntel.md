Choose either an AMD or Intel based on this """building a system for productivity, especially in a development environment with AI tools, the right combination of hardware is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring smooth multitasking. In your case, where you’re running multiple AI code editors (such as Visual Studio Code Insiders and Cursor.ai) and applications across two high-resolution displays, Your Samsung S90C Quantum Dot OLED and Odyssey G9 provide ample screen real estate, allowing you to run multiple IDEs, reference materials, and output displays concurrently. To achieve the 120Hz on the S90C and 240Hz on the Odyssey G9, ensuring your HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 cables are correctly set up is key, but this also depends on the GPU’s output capabilities.### IDE Performance

Tools like Visual Studio Code Insiders and Cursor.ai benefit from faster indexing and code suggestions. Setting up dedicated virtual environments for each project in tools like Conda or Docker can improve system stability and ensure each application gets the resources it needs.

### Fast Storage (SSD/NVMe)

Using fast SSDs or NVMe drives ensures that your system can quickly access and load large codebases or datasets without delays. This is particularly beneficial when working on AI models that require rapid read/write access to data.

### Efficient Workflow

You can optimize your workflow by leveraging containerization (e.g., Docker) to separate various development environments. This allows better resource management, so each project can utilize the available hardware optimally.

**Conclusion**
----------

For your setup focusing on high-resolution, multi-IDE productivity, and AI code development, a balance between high-speed RAM, a strong multi-core processor, and a powerful GPU like the NVIDIA RTX or A2000 will offer a fast, reliable, and scalable performance. High-resolution outputs and fast refresh rates will be seamlessly supported by this configuration, allowing you to focus purely on development tasks with minimal hardware bottlenecks."""
