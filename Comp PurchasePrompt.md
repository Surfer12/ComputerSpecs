Help me understand how to create or purchase a custom computer from Costco like a HP workstation Z2 at a student discount, or a z6 and upgrade later. I would like nvidia graphics though am new to understanding my options as a student who is learning and utilizing data science and machine learning as well as high bandwith memory intensive programming with java so the unified memory of the apple studio m2 ultra is appealing. I have a m1 pro laptop i have tried and like the memory of it though do not do any video editing and am not planning on doing much visualization with graphics rendering though am open to understanding how and when I would do so while learning Data Science and Probability and Computer Science At UCSB in California and Cal Poly SLO and well as Cuesta College. 

The m1 is 16bg of ram though it's the m1 pro 2021 version.
